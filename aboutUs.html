    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
      Yeshu Ke Nanhe Dost is a faith-based platform created to teach children about
      Jesus Christ through visual stories, blogs, Bible lessons, and creative content.
      Our mission is to make the Word of God simple, engaging, and joyful for young hearts.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that when children learn about Jesus at an early age, they develop
      strong spiritual roots that guide them throughout their lives. Using modern
      digital tools, we present Bible stories in a visual and easy-to-understand way
      so children can grow in faith, love, and obedience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our vision is to create a safe and positive online space where children and
      families can learn, explore, and experience God’s love together.

      <p>
        I am thankful to God for giving me the vision to start this platform for children.
        In today’s world, technology plays a major role in shaping young minds, and we
        want to use it to bring children closer to Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <p>
        This website is created to help children understand the Bible through visual
        storytelling, meaningful blogs, and creative lessons. Our goal is to present
        God’s Word in a simple, loving, and joyful way.
      </p>

      <p>
        I pray that this platform becomes a blessing for every child and family and
        helps raise a generation that loves Jesus and walks in His truth.
