    <p>About Us

Yeshu Ke Nanhe Dost is a faith-based children’s platform created with a heartfelt mission—to introduce children to the love, teachings, and values of Lord Jesus Christ in a joyful, simple, and creative way.

We believe that children learn best when faith is combined with creativity. That’s why, along with Bible stories and devotionals, we regularly provide colouring sheets, art activities, craft ideas, and hands-on learning resources based on biblical themes. These materials are designed to help children understand God’s Word while enjoying the process of learning.

Our content is not only useful for children but also a valuable support for parents, Sunday school teachers, and Christian educators. The teaching resources we share make biblical lessons easier to explain, teach, and remember—both at home and in the classroom.

In addition to our online content, Yeshu Ke Nanhe Dost also publishes biblical storybooks, colouring books, and other child-friendly Christian materials that help nurture faith, character, and creativity in young hearts.

More than just a blog, Yeshu Ke Nanhe Dost is a loving and safe space where children can grow spiritually, creatively, and morally—learning to see Jesus not only as God, but as their true friend and guide.

Together, let us plant seeds of faith today that will grow into strong, loving lives tomorrow.</p>
